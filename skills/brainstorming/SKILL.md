# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## Stack-Specific Decision Trees

When brainstorming features for your stack, work through these decision trees:

### Platform Decision

```
Is this feature...
├── iOS/native only?
│   └── Use indie-stack:swift-ios-app patterns
├── Web only?
│   └── Use Next.js + Vercel patterns
├── Backend/API only?
│   └── Use indie-stack:supabase-setup patterns
└── Full stack (mobile + web + backend)?
    └── Design backend first, then platform UIs
```

### Data Architecture

```
Does this feature need data persistence?
├── No → Local state only (SwiftUI @State, React useState)
├── Yes, local only → SwiftData (iOS) or localStorage (web)
├── Yes, synced across devices →
│   ├── Real-time sync needed?
│   │   ├── Yes → Supabase Realtime
│   │   └── No → Supabase REST + manual sync
│   └── Offline support needed?
│       ├── Yes → SwiftData + SyncService pattern
│       └── No → Direct Supabase queries
└── Yes, shared between users →
    └── Supabase with appropriate RLS policies
```

### Authentication Strategy

```
Does this feature need auth?
├── No → Public access
├── Yes, identified user only →
│   ├── New app? → Sign in with Apple (iOS) or magic link (web)
│   ├── Existing app? → Use existing AuthService
│   └── Trial flow? → One free action, then require sign-in
└── Yes, with roles/permissions →
    └── Add roles to profiles table + RLS policies
```

### AI Integration

```
Does this feature use AI?
├── No → Skip this section
├── Yes →
│   ├── Where does AI run?
│   │   ├── Edge Function (Supabase) → indie-stack:edge-function
│   │   └── Client-side → Not recommended (API key exposure)
│   ├── What AI provider?
│   │   ├── Vision/multimodal → Gemini (good price/performance)
│   │   ├── Text generation → Claude or GPT-4
│   │   └── Embeddings → OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
│   └── Structured output needed?
│       ├── Yes → Use JSON mode + Zod validation
│       └── No → Stream response to UI
```

### Offline-First Decision

```
Should this work offline?
├── Core feature that users expect to work anywhere →
│   └── YES: SwiftData local-first, sync when connected
├── Real-time collaborative feature →
│   └── NO: Require connection, show clear offline state
├── Read-heavy feature (viewing history, stats) →
│   └── YES: Cache data locally, refresh when connected
└── Write-heavy feature (creating content) →
    └── YES: Save locally, queue uploads for later
```

## Consulting Specialized Agents

**IMPORTANT: Don't guess on domain-specific questions. Consult experts.**

When you encounter questions that require specialized knowledge, dispatch the appropriate agent to get informed recommendations before presenting options to the user.

### When to Consult

| Question Type | Agent to Consult | Example Questions |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **UX/User Flow** | `product-ux-strategist` | "How should onboarding work?", "Modal vs sheet?", "Where should this button go?" |
| **iOS Architecture** | `principal-ios-engineer` | "Actor vs class?", "How to handle state?", "Navigation pattern?" |
| **Backend Design** | `staff-backend-architect` | "RLS policy approach?", "Edge Function structure?", "Caching strategy?" |

### How to Consult

1. **Formulate the question** with full context about the feature being designed
2. **Dispatch the agent** with a specific question and the options you're considering
3. **Get the recommendation** with reasoning
4. **Present to user** with the agent's recommendation marked as "(Recommended by [agent])"

### Example Flow

```
User: "I want to add a delete feature for pours"

You (thinking): This involves UX decisions. Let me consult the UX expert.

[Dispatch product-ux-strategist]:
"We're designing a delete feature for pour photos. The user wants to delete
pours from their history. What's the best UX pattern for destructive actions
in a mobile app? Options I'm considering:
1. Swipe to delete with undo toast
2. Delete button with confirmation dialog
3. Edit mode with multi-select delete
Context: This is a latte art grading app, pours have sentimental value."

[Agent returns]: "Recommend option 1 (swipe + undo) because..."

You (to user): "For the delete interaction, I consulted a UX expert. Here are the options:

**Option 1: Swipe to delete with undo toast** (Recommended by UX strategist)
- Quick gesture for single deletions
- 5-second undo window prevents accidents
- Matches iOS conventions

Option 2: Confirmation dialog
- More explicit but adds friction
- Better for truly irreversible actions

Option 3: Edit mode with multi-select
- Good for bulk operations
- Overkill for occasional single deletes

The UX strategist recommends Option 1. What do you think?"
```

### Agents Available

- **`product-ux-strategist`** - User flows, onboarding, UI patterns, navigation, platform conventions
- **`principal-ios-engineer`** - Swift architecture, SwiftUI patterns, SwiftData, concurrency, performance
- **`staff-backend-architect`** - Supabase, database design, API patterns, caching, AI integration

### Rules for Consultation

1. **Always consult for UX questions** - Don't guess on user experience
2. **Consult for architecture decisions** - "How should I structure this?" → ask the expert
3. **Don't consult for simple decisions** - "What should I name this variable?" → decide yourself
4. **Present the recommendation clearly** - Mark which option the expert recommended and why
5. **User can override** - The recommendation is advice, not a mandate

## Key Questions to Ask

When brainstorming, make sure to cover:

1. **Platform**: iOS only, web only, or both?
2. **Auth**: Who can use this? Anonymous, authenticated, or specific roles?
3. **Data**: Where does data live? Local, synced, or shared?
4. **Offline**: Should this work without internet?
5. **AI**: Is AI involved? Where should it run?
6. **UX**: What's the happy path? What are the error cases? **(Consult UX strategist)**

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to create the implementation plan?"
- Use indie-stack:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan
- Use indie-stack:subagent-driven-development to execute

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
- **Think UX first** - Every feature should have clear user flows
